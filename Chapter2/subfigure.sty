%$%  Revision 1.5  92/07/23  01:12:55  sdc
%$%  Fixed a bug which caused different sized captions to be misaligned.
%$%  This was pointed out by Simon Marshall (S.Marshal@Hull.ac.uk).
%$%  
%$%  Revision 1.4  90/10/22  17:04:28  cochran
%$%  Added a hack to allow the \label command to be used within the
%$%  body of the subfigure giving a reference label in the form
%$%  \arabic{thefigure}\thesubfigure.  Added standard file header for
%$%  style. 
%$%  
%$%  Revision 1.3  90/10/22  17:04:28  cochran
%$%  Changed test for empty caption inside of \@subfigure to compare
%$%  tokens and not the caption vs. \@empty.  The former (incorrect)
%$%  test caused an error when the first two letters of the caption
%$%  were the same.
%$%
%$%  Revision 1.2  89/08/30  07:18:29  cochran
%$%  Added a separate bottom margin and expanded the comments.

%$%             \subfigure[CAPTIONtext]{FIGUREbox}
%%%
%%% Creates a subfigure box with an optional CAPTION under a FIGURE.
%%% The FIGURE is centered with \subfigtopskip of vertical space added
%%% above and \subfigcapskip vertical space added below it followed by
%%% the CAPTION.  The subfigure is followed by \subfigbottomskip of
%%% vertical space added at the bottom.
%%%
%%% If a CAPTION is given (including a null CAPTION '[]') then the
%%% subfigure is labeled with a counter supplied by the macro
%%% '\thesubfigure' which returns '(a) ', '(b) ', etc.  If desired,
%%% this macro may be redefined.  The counter used for labeling the
%%% subfigures is 'subfigure' and is incremented for each subfigure
%%% regardless of whether a CAPTION was printed.
%%%
%%% One example of use is to surround the figure in a tabular
%%% environment (this preserves alignment along the bottom of the
%%% figures when the figures and/or the captions are different
%%% heights): 
%%%
%%%      \begin{figure}                      *---------*   *---------*
%%%        \begin{center}                    |  .   .  |   | . .  .  |

%%%            \subfigure[First]{...}        *---------*   *---------*

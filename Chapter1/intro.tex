\section{Research Contributions}
The original contributions of the present research are listed below:
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]

\item Design of teleoperated mobile platform remote surveillance application.

 

\item Predictive visual feedback for time delayed teleoperation of mobile platform



\end{enumerate}
\section{Thesis Organization}
The thesis contains seven chapters and five appendices. They are organized as follows:
\paragraph*{Chapter 1: Introduction\\}

\paragraph*{Chapter 2: Literature Review\\}


\paragraph*{Chapter 3: Design of Mobile Platform\\}
This chapter highlights the design considerations of tele-operated mobile platform based on environmental conditions mission requirements. This paper presents the design and control scheme of a mobile manipulator used for radiation survey of Cyclotron vault and cave regions. It discusses the mechanical design for the traction system, the steering gear and the scissor mechanism. Selection of  steering system based on terrain condition and power requirement is also discussed.   
\paragraph*{Chapter 4: Mathematica Modelling of Wheeled Mobile Platform \\}
In this chapter, we present the orthogonal compliment method for deriving the dynamic equation of four wheeled differentially driven platform. The platform has two actuated wheels and two passive wheels. Different types of passive wheels has been studied and there corresponding dynamic equation are presented. The main contribution of this paper is derivation of dynamic equation a differentially driven  mobile platform with the most general form of passive wheel.

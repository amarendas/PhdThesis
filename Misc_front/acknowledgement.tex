The work presented in this thesis would not have been possible without the assistance
of countless individuals.  To all these people, I extend my eternal gratitude. However, despite being a dangerous practice, I would like to single out a few, select, individuals for special recognition. This thesis would not have seen the light of the day without the continuous and persistent motivation of my guide Prof. S. K. Saha.    
I am deeply grateful to my co-supervisor,Professor S. Bhasin of Department of Electric Engineering, IIT-D, for his continued encouragement and invaluable suggestions in the field of control engineering and in particular adaptive control during this work. He has been instrumental in introducing me to the latest research results  in the field of time delayed non-linear systems.  
I also express my gratitude to Dr. Deepak N Badodkar, my supervisor at my parent organization BARC, Mumbai for his encouragement and the logistic support he had provided through out the tenure of my research.   


It will be imprudent not to mention the help and support provided by my colleagues Shri Rahul V Sakrikar. One person on whom I fell back in case of any hardware issues, it was him. His experience and field knowledge has been highly enriching,  while discussing technical issues such as  interpretation of graphs and results. I still remember his \textit{encouragin}g words, "Are tera PhD ka kya hua. Saha kuch kaam nahi deya kya". Another colleagues , Shri Shishir Kr. Singh has provided his selfless service to help me develop all the software required for running the actual system. With out his support it would have been impossible to take experimental runs and data collection. I express my deepest regards for them.

I cannot forget the support and help provide by Dr. Abraham Ribby, Dr. Parmannad, Dr. Aamir Abdulla and Dr. Arun Uday during my stay at IIT-Delhi for 6 months during  my course work. Thereafter they provided all kind of support needed from fee submission to physical submission of progress report in each semester, to name a few.  


Finally, I thank my two daughters, Akaisha and Sayuri, my mother for there patience  and support. Special thanks to my wife Namrata, who had taken upon herself  the responsibility of managing the family's without my slightest help. In absence of  her support, patience and companionship this journey would not have been completed.

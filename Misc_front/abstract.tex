 A customized mobile manipulator was designed, developed and fabricated  for radiation measurement and mapping. The detail design aspects based on the environment and mission requirement is presented in the thesis. The dynamic model of the system was developed and simulations were performed for specific paths to verify the actuator requirements and response time. The user interface and control architecture implemented on the mobile robot for teleoperation  were developed for convenient and reliable functioning of the same. The time delay introduced due to  video data transfer and its effects on system's stability and poor operator performance is demonstrated using simulations. A predictive display of the remote environment based on mathematical model of the mobile robot  and RGB-Depth sensor data received from remote location was proposed, which was practically implemented. This strategy has largely improved robot's navigation by the operator even over significantly  delayed communication network.

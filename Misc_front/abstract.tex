\noindent 
 A customized mobile manipulator was designed, developed and fabricated  for radiation measurement and mapping. The detail design aspects based on the environment and mission requirement is discussed. The dynamic model of the system was also developed and simulation was carried out for specific path to verify the actuator requirements and response time. The user interface and control architecture implemented on the mobile robot for teleoperation  is described. The time delay introduced in video data transfer due to bandwidth limitation and image processing at camera end and its effect on system stability and poor operator performance is demonstrated using simulation. A predictive display of remote environment based on mathematical model of the mobile robot  and RGB-Depth senor data received from remote location is developed and implemented. This strategy has largely improved robot navigation by the operator even over delayed communication network.
